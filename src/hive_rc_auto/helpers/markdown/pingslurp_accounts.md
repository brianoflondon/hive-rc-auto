## Pingslurp Overview

**Pingslurp** is a system running in the background watching every single Podping which goes out. It stores approximately 3 months of Podpings and performs data analysis.

The two graphs on this page show the activity by any Hive account which sends podpings.

### Graphs

The lower graph shows the last 4 hours of activity and shows IRIs per minute.
