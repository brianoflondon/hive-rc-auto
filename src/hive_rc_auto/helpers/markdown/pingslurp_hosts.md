## Pingslurp Hosts information

This page gives an idea of which Podcast Hosting companies are actively sending updates via Podping. It allows us to spot if there has been an interruption in the stream from any of the larger hosts like Buzzsprout, Transistor or RSS.com.

### Gauge Explanation

The gauges show the number of IRIs sent in the previous full hour compared to the hour before that. The Blue mark on the gauge is the 8 hour moving average and the red area indicates the lowest number of IRIs seen in an hour over the previous 72 hours.

The graph at the bottom shows the total number of IRIs sent per hour with a trace line for the 8 hour moving average.
